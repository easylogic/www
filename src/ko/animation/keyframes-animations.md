### Keyframes 

Record changes in attributes for specific intervals.

The interval is designated as offset and the property value changing at each offset can be defined.

Individually changing properties are not visible on the screen, providing a simple editor that you can edit yourself.


### Animations 

After setting the keyframe, set the Animation to use it.


* name: none
* duration: 0s
* timing-function: ease
* delay: 0s
* iteration-count: 1
* direction: normal
* fill-mode: none
* play-state: running

name contains the name specified in the keyframe and timing is edited with the cubic-bezier editor.
