### Additional Mode

In add mode you can draw a polygon by adding points.

Points can be drawn subsequently by clicking.

If you press ESC or Enter in add mode or the last point overlaps with the start point, the editing ends and changes to the selection mode.


### Selection Mode

The selection mode can be set to the basic fill and strok settings required for SVG elements.

Double click in the selection mode to enter the edit mode.

### Edit Mode


#### Move point

In edit mode, you can move points on a straight line or points on a curve.

#### Add points

You can add a point at that point by hovering and clicking on the line between points.

#### Delete Point

You can delete a point with alt + click.
