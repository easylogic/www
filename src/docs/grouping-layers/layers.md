# Layers

Layer is a drawing object. 

Drawing objects have the power to express themselves. 

Express your way with your own editor. 

With the drawing objects we do the actual design.

A Layer can also contain other Layers as its children. 

The child component has a relative position of the upper layer. 

That way, they maintain their position relative to their parents.
