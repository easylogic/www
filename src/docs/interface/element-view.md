# Element View

This is where the elements are actually drawn. Because it's a css-based tool, you can generate code as you see it.

<img src='/images/editor/element-view.png' />

### Rendering Layer

ArtBoard is located in ElementView, and Layer is added in ArtBoard to complete output on screen.

All objects in the ElementView are objects to draw.

Click on an individual layer or ArtBoard to change to the Selection state.
